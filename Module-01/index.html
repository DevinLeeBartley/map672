    <h2>Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto</h2>
    
    <p>
        I find the Floating Sheep Manifesto to be a salient and practical manifesto for the modern mapper, because it importantly highlights the need for the Coder, Cartographer, and Critic to band together in order to improve the world of maps in the  democratized era of web-mapping. It seems all too true that often each of these worlds are occupied by specialists, who are either unaware or ignorant of the aims of other groups that this essay highlights. 
        
    <p>
        One particular group that this essay doesn't consider is what I would call the map worker. My characterization of the worker is someone who works in the world of maps, but does not make them for their own personal objectives or curiosity, but rather as a means of serving the needs of an employer to generate personal income. There is a rapidly ballooning number of map workers worldwide as GIS and digital mapping technologies expand at at rapid pace in government agencies, private consultancies, NGO's, armies, marketing firms, etc. Because of technology, many groups are finding it economical to hire employees to map things that were previously not spatially characterized in order to meet the expressed goals of their organizations. I would argue that these map workers are instruments of power while embodying many of the characteristics of the Coder and the Cartographer (though typically not the Critic). Further reflection on the effects of this growing map workforce are needed, as I believe that the expanding monetization of mapping work has significant implications to how maps are used and understood.
     <p>   
        In the same vein I think that point #5b in the manifesto is the most important, because as the prevalence of web-cartography and the class of map workers expands, more things that "should not be mapped" will likely be mapped. The potential for problematic geo-based surveillance and exploitation is likely to grow in lockstep with the growth in easily harnessed cartographic power while at the same time well meaning map makers will have broadened access to powerful map tools to fight back against this type of 'top down' institutional power in their own way. 
      <p>  
    I applaud the Floating Sheep Manifesto for pointing out that we need to be diligent in constantly assessing and critiquing the inherit power that maps have in a changing world. This type of assessment could empower us to use maps in more positive ways and also improve the quality of tools and techniques that mappers have available to them to effect social change as technology progresses.
