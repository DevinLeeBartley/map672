For this first lab assignment, you'll be pushing your newly-created *map672* repository to your GitHub account. To receive full credit for this assignment, the following **requirements** must be met.

1. Create your GitHub account and *map672* repository (1 pt)
2. Provide your instructor with your GitHub username by email through Canvas (1 pt)
3. Add your instructor as a collaborator to your *map672* repository through GitHub (1 pt)
4. Read the Floating Sheep Manifesto ([http://manifesto.floatingsheep.org/](http://manifesto.floatingsheep.org/))
5. Push updated files to your repository, including:
    * an updated README.md file (see specifications below) (3 pts)
    * an updated *index.html* file (see specifications below) (4 pts)
    
## Specifications of the deliverables

### README.md file

Update the *README.md* file created and modified through lesson-01 to include a sub-heading titled "My Learning Objectives" (use two ## to make a subheading) followed by 4 &ndash; 6 bullet points of specific skills and learning outcomes you home to achieve within this course.

### index.html file

Update the *index.html* file to include a sub-heading, written between two h2 tags (&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;), titled: "Reaction to the Floating Sheep Manifesto". Follow this sub-heading with a paragraph or two (minimum 250 words) that describes your reaction to the writing. Feel free to be critical, but consider addressing:

* where you position yourself among the coder/cartographer/critique and why?
* what priorities will you set as you move forward in your mapping career?
* which of the six manifesto points do you find most provocative or problematic and why?

## Submission

Provide a link to your repository within the Canvas LMS for lab-01 assignment by the due date.
